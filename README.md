# Spatial Feature-Based Point Cloud Prioritization

This project demonstrates a simple simulation of prioritizing spatial features in point cloud data using Python. The prioritization is based on importance scores, which are used to select the most critical points from a 3D voxel grid. 

## Features
- Generate mock 3D point cloud data
- Assign randomized importance scores to points
- Use a max-heap for efficient prioritization of high-importance points
- Visualize the original point cloud and prioritized points in 3D

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
